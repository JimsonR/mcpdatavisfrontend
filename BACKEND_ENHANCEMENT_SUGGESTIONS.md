# Enhanced Backend Suggestions for Structured Agent Streaming

## Current State Analysis

Your backend is already quite good! The structured streaming with proper tags is working correctly. However, here are some enhancements that could improve the frontend's understanding:

## 1. Enhanced Reasoning Preservation

```python
async def structured_agent_stream():
    try:
        step_count = 0
        last_thought_content = ""
        accumulated_reasoning = ""  # Track natural reasoning between steps

        async for step in agent.astream(messages):
            if step["type"] == "thought":
                step_count += 1
                thought_content = step['content']
                last_thought_content = thought_content.strip()

                # Include any accumulated natural reasoning before the thought
                if accumulated_reasoning:
                    yield json.dumps({"type": "content", "data": accumulated_reasoning}) + "\n"
                    accumulated_reasoning = ""

                yield json.dumps({"type": "content", "data": f"<thinking>{thought_content}</thinking>"}) + "\n"

            elif step["type"] == "reasoning":  # If your agent supports this
                # Natural reasoning that flows between structured steps
                accumulated_reasoning += step['content']

            elif step["type"] == "tool_execution":
                # Include any accumulated reasoning before tool execution
                if accumulated_reasoning:
                    yield json.dumps({"type": "content", "data": accumulated_reasoning}) + "\n"
                    accumulated_reasoning = ""

                tool_name = step.get('tool_name', 'Unknown Tool')

                yield json.dumps({"type": "content", "data": f"<tool_use>"}) + "\n"
                yield json.dumps({"type": "content", "data": f"<action>{tool_name}</action>"}) + "\n"

                if step.get("arguments"):
                    args_formatted = json.dumps(step['arguments'], indent=2)
                    yield json.dumps({"type": "content", "data": f"<action_input>{args_formatted}</action_input>"}) + "\n"

                if step.get("result"):
                    result_str = str(step['result'])
                    yield json.dumps({"type": "content", "data": f"<observation>{result_str}</observation>"}) + "\n"

                yield json.dumps({"type": "content", "data": f"</tool_use>"}) + "\n"

                # Add natural transition text after tool execution
                yield json.dumps({"type": "content", "data": "\n"}) + "\n"
```

## 2. Better Content Flow Markers

```python
# Add flow markers to help frontend understand context
async def structured_agent_stream():
    # ... existing code ...

    # Before each major section, add context
    if step["type"] == "tool_execution":
        # Add reasoning context if this tool call follows from previous thinking
        yield json.dumps({"type": "content", "data": "Now I'll execute this action:\n\n"}) + "\n"

    elif step["type"] == "final_answer":
        # Add transition text
        yield json.dumps({"type": "content", "data": "\nBased on my analysis:\n\n"}) + "\n"
```

## 3. Enhanced Error Handling

```python
# Better error context for frontend
except Exception as e:
    error_detail = {
        "error_type": type(e).__name__,
        "error_message": str(e),
        "step_context": step_count,
        "last_action": getattr(locals(), 'tool_name', 'unknown')
    }
    error_content = f"<error>{json.dumps(error_detail, indent=2)}</error>"
    yield json.dumps({"type": "error", "data": error_content}) + "\n"
```

## 4. Progress Indicators

```python
# Add progress context for better UX
async def structured_agent_stream():
    total_steps = 0  # Estimate if possible
    step_count = 0

    async for step in agent.astream(messages):
        step_count += 1

        # Add progress context
        progress_info = {
            "step": step_count,
            "type": step["type"],
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
        }

        # Send progress as metadata (not displayed content)
        yield json.dumps({"type": "progress", "data": progress_info}) + "\n"

        # Then send the actual content...
```

## Frontend Enhancements Needed

The frontend should also be enhanced to:

1. **Handle Progress Metadata**: Process progress updates without displaying them
2. **Better Real-time Updates**: Update content more smoothly during streaming
3. **Context Awareness**: Understand when reasoning flows between structured blocks
4. **Error Recovery**: Better error handling and recovery during streaming

## Current Status

Your backend is actually very well structured! The main issue was in the frontend parsing, which we've now fixed. The suggestions above are optimizations that could make the experience even smoother.
