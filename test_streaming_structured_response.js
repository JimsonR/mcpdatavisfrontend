I need to analyze the user's sales data to identify trends and patterns. Let me start by examining the data structure and then create appropriate visualizations.

I'll help you analyze your sales data to identify key trends and insights. Let me start by loading and examining the data structure.

<tool_use>
<action>load_csv</action>
<action_input>
{
  "csv_path": "/path/to/sales_data.csv",
  "df_name": "sales_data"
}
</action_input>
<observation>
Successfully loaded CSV into dataframe 'sales_data' with 2,847 rows and 5 columns: ['Date', 'Product', 'Sales', 'Quantity', 'Region']
Date range: 2022-01-01 to 2023-12-31
</observation>
</tool_use>

Great! Now let me create a visualization to show the sales trends over time.

<tool_use>
<action>create_visualization</action>
<action_input>

  "df_name": "sales_data",
  "plot_type": "line",
  "x": "Date",
  "y": "Sales",
  "title": "Sales Trends Over Time"

    }]
  },
  "options": {
    "responsive": true,
    "plugins": {
      "title": {
        "display": true,
        "text": "Sales Trends Over Time"
      }
    },
    "scales": {
      "y": {
        "beginAtZero": true,
        "title": {

        }

Based on my analysis of your sales data, I've identified several key trends:

## ðŸ“ˆ **Key Findings**

### **Overall Growth**
- **56% growth** from Q1 2022 ($125K) to Q4 2023 ($195K)
- Consistent year-over-year improvement in performance
- Strong upward trajectory despite seasonal fluctuations

### **Seasonal Patterns**
- **Q4 Peak Performance**: Both 2022 and 2023 show highest sales in Q4
- **Q3 Dips**: Consistent drop in Q3 sales, likely summer slowdown
- **Recovery Pattern**: Strong Q4 recovery each year

### **Business Insights**
1. **Holiday Effect**: Q4 consistently outperforms other quarters
2. **Growth Momentum**: 2023 performance exceeded 2022 across all quarters
3. **Market Opportunity**: Q3 represents potential for improvement

The line chart clearly visualizes these trends, showing your business's strong growth trajectory with predictable seasonal patterns that can inform future planning and inventory management.

The user is asking for analysis of a dataset that I need to load first. Let me attempt to load the data.
</thought>

<action>load_csv</action>

<action_input>
{
  "csv_path": "/nonexistent/file.csv",
  "df_name": "test_data"
}
</action_input>

<observation>
Error: File not found at path '/nonexistent/file.csv'
</observation>

<error>
I apologize, but I encountered an error while trying to load the specified CSV file. The file path '/nonexistent/file.csv' does not exist or is not accessible.

To proceed with your data analysis, please:

1. **Verify the file path** - Ensure the CSV file exists at the specified location
2. **Check file permissions** - Make sure the file is readable
3. **Provide the correct path** - You can upload the file or provide the correct file path

Would you like to try again with a different file path, or would you prefer to upload your data directly?

console.log(

console.log("Test streaming error response:", testStreamingErrorResponse);

export { testStreamingErrorResponse, testStreamingStructuredResponse };
