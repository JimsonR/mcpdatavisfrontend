# Continue Button Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a "Continue" button feature in the chat interface that allows users to continue conversations when the AI agent hits limits (recursion limit, timeout, etc.).

## Features Added

### 1. Enhanced Message Interface
```typescript
interface Message {
  id: string
  type: 'user' | 'assistant'
  content: string
  timestamp: Date
  chartData?: any
  toolExecutions?: ToolExecutionType[]
  toolExecutionCharts?: Array<{data: any, type: 'plotly' | 'recharts' | 'unknown', executionIndex: number}>
  canContinue?: boolean  // NEW: Indicates if this message can be continued
  error?: boolean        // NEW: Indicates if this message has an error
}
```

### 2. Updated API Types
```typescript
export interface ChatResponse {
  response: string
  error?: boolean  // NEW: Error flag from backend
}

export interface DetailedAgentResponse {
  response: string
  tool_executions: ToolExecution[]
  full_conversation: Array<{...}>
  error?: boolean  // NEW: Error flag from backend
}
```

### 3. Enhanced sendMessage Function
- Now supports `continueFromLastMessage` parameter
- Automatically detects when agent hits limits (recursion, timeout)
- Sets `canContinue` flag when appropriate
- Provides user feedback with toast notifications

### 4. Continue Button UI
- Appears below assistant messages that can be continued
- Only shown when agent hits limits and not in error state
- Provides clear visual feedback with loading states
- Includes explanatory text

### 5. Visual Indicators
- **Orange background**: Messages that can be continued
- **Red background**: Messages with errors
- **Blue "Continue" button**: Action to resume conversation
- **Loading indicator**: Shows "Continuing..." state

## How It Works

### Detection Logic
The system detects continuable scenarios by checking response text for:
- "recursion limit"
- "execution time"
- "hit recursion limit"
- "task may be too complex"
- "Agent hit recursion limit"

### Continue Flow
1. User clicks "Continue" button
2. System sends special continue message: "Please continue from where you left off and complete the task."
3. Full conversation history is maintained
4. Agent resumes processing from where it left off

### User Experience
1. **Normal Chat**: Regular conversation flow
2. **Agent Pauses**: Orange message bubble with continue button appears
3. **Continue Action**: User clicks continue, sees "Continuing..." indicator
4. **Resumed Conversation**: Agent continues with full context

## Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Recursion Limit Hit
```
User: "Analyze this large dataset and create 5 different visualizations"
Agent: [Processes tools...] "Agent hit recursion limit. The task may be too complex..."
[Continue button appears]
User: [Clicks Continue]
Agent: [Resumes from where it left off]
```

### Scenario 2: Timeout
```
User: "Perform complex data analysis with multiple steps"
Agent: [Processes...] "execution time limit reached..."
[Continue button appears]
User: [Clicks Continue]
Agent: [Continues the analysis]
```

## Frontend Implementation Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [continuing, setContinuing] = useState(false)
```

### Continue Function
```typescript
const continueConversation = () => {
  sendMessage(true)  // true = continue from last message
}
```

### Message Styling
```typescript
className={`max-w-xs lg:max-w-2xl px-4 py-2 rounded-lg ${
  message.type === 'user'
    ? 'bg-primary-600 text-white'
    : message.error
    ? 'bg-red-50 text-red-900 border border-red-200'
    : message.canContinue
    ? 'bg-orange-50 text-orange-900 border border-orange-200'
    : 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-900'
}`}
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users can seamlessly continue complex tasks
2. **Error Recovery**: Clear indication when agent encounters limits
3. **Context Preservation**: Full conversation history maintained
4. **Visual Clarity**: Color-coded messages for different states
5. **Workflow Continuity**: No need to restart complex tasks

## Future Enhancements

1. **Auto-continue**: Option to automatically continue after a delay
2. **Continue with modifications**: Allow users to modify the continue prompt
3. **Retry logic**: Automatic retry with adjusted parameters
4. **Progress indicators**: Show task completion percentage
5. **Continue history**: Track how many times a conversation was continued

## Testing

Test the feature by:
1. Using agent mode with complex, multi-step tasks
2. Triggering recursion limits with deeply nested operations
3. Running long-running tasks that might timeout
4. Verifying continue button appears and functions correctly
5. Checking that conversation context is preserved

The continue button feature significantly enhances the robustness and user experience of agent-based conversations, allowing for seamless handling of complex, multi-step tasks that may exceed initial processing limits.
